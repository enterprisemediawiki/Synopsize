/**
 *	Put any javascript you need here
 *
 **/

// Note that sometimes you need to make sure your code doesn't run until the document is 
// fully ready. The following is a way to do that, using the jQuery javascript library
$(document).ready(function(){

	// code that you don't want to run until the document is fully loaded 
	// should go here.
	
});
